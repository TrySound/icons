# Colored Icon

An Icon is a piece of visual element, but we must ensure its accessibility while using it. It can have 2 purposes:

- **Decorative only** — for example, it illustrates a label next to it. We must ensure that it is ignored by screen readers, by setting `aria-hidden` attribute (ex: `<ColoredIcon icon="check" aria-hidden />`)
- **Non-decorative** — it means that it delivers information. For example, an icon as only child in a button. The meaning can be obvious visually, but it must have a proper text alternative via `aria-label` for screen readers. (ex: `<ColoredIcon icon="print" aria-label="Print this document" />`)
